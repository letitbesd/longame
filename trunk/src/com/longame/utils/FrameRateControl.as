	/**
	 * <p>One of the most effective and easy ways to optimize your Flash application is controlling the player's 
	 * frame rate per second (fps)</p>
	 * 
	 * <p>Consider the following.  A user has a browser open with 5-10 tabs and each tab has about 2-3 swfs.  
	 * Ideally, when you don't use a swf it will reduce the memory footprint.  How about few AIR apps and web 
	 * browsers all running at the same time?</p>
	 * 
	 * The idea is to have one utility class to help you control and adjust your fps and take into account 
	 * the following:
	 * 
	 * <ul>
	 * 		<li>Reducing fps when your app is inactive</li>
	 * 		<li>Increase the fps once the app is active again</li>
	 * 		<li>Increase fps while animation is playing to create a more smooth experience and keeping a stack of all the animations being played to know when we can drop the fps.</li>
	 * 		<li>Provide a cross platform API  (Pure AS3, Flex, AIR)</li>
 	 * </ul>
 	 * 
	 * For more information visit: http://elromdesign.com/blog/2010/07/04/api-to-control-players-frame-rate-per-second-on-pure-as3flexair-apps/
	 * 
	 * @Example	Here is an example for pure AS3 project.
	 * 
	 * <listing version="3.0">
	 * 		var framerateManager:FrameRateOptimizer = new FrameRateOptimizer( this, true );
	 * </listing>
	 * 
	 * @Example	Example using the Flex 4 framework.
	 * 
	 * <listing version="3.0">
	 * 		var framerateManager:FrameRateOptimizer = new FrameRateOptimizer( FlexGlobals.topLevelApplication, true );
	 * </listing>

	 * @Example	AIR example:
	 * 
	 * <listing version="3.0">
